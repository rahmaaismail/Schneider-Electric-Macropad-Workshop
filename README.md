# ðŸ”¢ Schneider Electric Custom 3x3 Macropad Workshop

An 8-week collaborative project where we each individually designed and built a fully functional 3x3 macropad from scratch including PCB design, firmware programming, mechanical casing, and project management using Agile methodologies.

## ðŸ›  Overview

The macropad features 9 mechanical switches in a 3x3 layout, powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. It was designed to type numbers 1â€“9 via custom keymaps programmed in QMK firmware.
