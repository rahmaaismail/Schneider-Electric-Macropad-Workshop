# ðŸ”¢ 3x3 Macropad â€“ Schneider Electric Workshop Project
This project was developed during an 8-week hardware design workshop in collaboration with Schneider Electric. It features a custom-built 3x3 macropad that types digits 1â€“9, combining electrical, mechanical, and firmware design.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Circuit & PCB Design: Schematic and board layout created in KiCad

Mechanical Design: 3D-printed casing modeled in Fusion 360

Firmware: Programmed using QMK Firmware and C, based on open-source keyboard layouts

Assembly: Soldered components to create a working PCBA and mounted mechanical switches

Project Management: Followed an Agile workflow and used Miro for planning

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
KiCad Fusion 360 QMK Firmware C Miro Agile Soldering
