# ðŸ”¢ 3x3 Macropad â€“ Schneider Electric Workshop Project

This project was developed during an 8-week hardware design workshop in collaboration with **Schneider Electric**. The result: a fully functional custom-built **3x3 macropad** that types digits **1â€“9**, integrating electrical, mechanical, and firmware components.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Circuit & PCB Design**  
  Designed the schematic and PCB layout using **KiCad**, including custom routing and footprint creation.

- **Mechanical Design**  
  Created a 3D-printed casing in **Fusion 360**, with precise fitting for the PCB and mechanical switches.

- **Firmware Development**  
  Programmed the macropad using **QMK Firmware** and **C**, based on open-source keyboard logic and custom keymaps.

- **Hardware Assembly**  
  Soldered all components onto the custom PCB, mounted mechanical key switches, and completed final assembly.

- **Project Management**  
  Utilized an **Agile workflow** with sprint-based planning and **Miro** for team collaboration and tracking progress.
